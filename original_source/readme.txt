  AVI FourCC Changer v1.00 - www.inmatrix.com
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, this thing is pretty simple, all it does is read the FourCC
code from any given AVI file and allow you to set anything in it's
place.

There are some default entries which you can use.

Please note, putting a bad FourCC code will
make your AVI unplayable.

Full Delphi source code is in the source.zip file, enjoy.

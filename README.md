  AVI FourCC Changer 
---------------------

AVI FourCC Changer is a tool for changing the FourCC codes in AVI files
from a list of known FourCC codes.

This version is a Freepascal port of the original Delphi sourcecode which can
also handle more FourCC codes than the default entries of the original
FourCC changer.
The list of existing FourCC codes can be edited and expanded in the
simple CSV style textfile database "FourCC.dat".

Please note, putting a bad FourCC code will make your AVI unplayable.

The old full Delphi source for Version 1.0 code on which this port is
based is available at: http://www.fourcc.org/changer/
The license is unknown but since it has been available as source code
for years it will be assumed it is open source without any license.

The Freepascal port will be also opensource licensed under the GPLv2.

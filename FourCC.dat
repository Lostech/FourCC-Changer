#	FOURCC [TAB] NAME [TAB] Summary
#
3IV1	3ivx	MPEG4-based codec. Used by 3ivx Delta 1.0-3.5. FOURCC "3IV0" was also used for a while but never publicly released.

8BPS	8BPS	Planar RGB Codec. RLE codec storing RGB image in planar format under Quicktime.
AASC	AASC	This codec is part of Autodesk's discontinued Animator Studio for Windows. 
ABYR	ABYR	Apparently a low resolution, low frame rate (6fps) codec similar to AJPG which is used in implementing movie capture in some digital cameras.
ADV1	ADV1	WaveCodec. Apparently used in various CCTV products.

AMPG	AMPG	Codec for Array VideoONE hardware-based MPEG compression system.
ANIM	ANIM	No information available for this codec.
AP41	AP41	Another hacked version of Microsoft's MP43 codec. One source recommends against installing this codec "due to its occasional tendency to modify client structures". Apparently this means that it can destroy or otherwise mess up the  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\avifile section of your registry leaving some tools incapable of playing video any more.
ASLC	ASLC	Alparysoft Lossless Codec. Codec offering approximately 5x compression in mathematically lossless mode or 5-15x compression in "visually lossless" operation.
ASV1	ASV1	Asus Video. Codec supplied with the Asus TNT Video Capture adapter. Supposedly a very simple, DCT-based codec.
ASV2	ASV2	Asus Video (2). New codec from Asus. Supposedly a very simple DCT codec.
ASVX	ASVX	Asus Video 2.0. Unusual codec which stores audio in the .avi file but puts the video in a companion .asv file.

AURA	AURA	No information available for this codec.
AVC1	AVC1	Apple's version of the MPEG4 part 10/H.264 standard apparently.
AVRN	AVRN	Also known as ADVJ in Quicktime files.
BA81	BA81	This format stores raw 8bit Bayer samples. The Bayer color filter array is described here: http://www.siliconimaging.com/RGB%20Bayer.htm
BINK	BINK	Bink Video. Pretty popular codec in Windows games. I'm not sure if this is available as a standard Windows codec but the web site makes it sound interesting enough to list here even if it does require non-standard tools to use.
BLZ0	BLZ0	MPEG-4 codec used in WarCraft 3 movies.
BT20	BT20	Prosumer Video. Codec optimised for realtime compression of YUV images.
BTCV	BTCV	This, now obsolete, format supported a special data format used by the Brooktree Bt2115 chipset which could perform "software encoded video output" - a kind of software TV-out capability.

CTRX	CTRX	No information available for this codec.
CVID	CVID	Cinepak. Originally owned by Supermac then Radius, now P & B.

DIV3	DIV3	DivX MPEG-4. Low motion codec (optimised for low motion source material?). Several sources tell me that this is an old and illegal codec that should not be used to encode new material.
DIV4	DIV4	DivX MPEG-4. Fast motion codec.Several sources tell me that this is an old and illegal codec that should not be used to encode new material.
DIV5	DIV5	Apparently almost as old as DIV3 and DIV4. Changing DIV5 AVI's FOURCC to DIV3 or DIV4 seems to allow them to play just fine.
DIVX	DivX	This FOURCC code is used for versions 4.0 and later of the DivX codec. DivX, "the MP3 of video,"  is the popular and market-leading MPEG-4 video codec that is emerging as the standard for full screen, full motion, DVD-quality video over IP-based networks. Apparently version 5 also encodes using FOURCC DX50.
DM4V	DM4V	MPEG4 codec compatible with DivX4 and 5.
DMB1	DMB1	Rainbow Runner hardware compression. Hardware codec used by Matrox Rainbow Runner video capture product. Apparently a form of Motion JPEG). 
DMB2	DMB2	MJPEG codec used by Paradigm.
DMK2	DMK2	Movies generated by a ViewSonic V36 PDA appear to be AVI files using this video codec. Oddly enough, they are named .mpg - go figure.
DSVD	DSVD	The DSVD codec is a VFW-based compressor that firewire- and DV-based capture cards use. It is supported by Graphedit (from divx-digest.com), Adobe Premier and StudioDV. VirtualDub doesn't support the format. I suspect that this and DVSD are one and the same - perhaps one of my informants typed the FOURCC wrongly?
DUCK	DUCK	Rather nice RGB codec which, strangely enough, appears to have two distinct FOURCCs.
DV25	DV25	DVCPRO. SMPTE 314M 25Mb/s compressed video. A professional variant of DVC (dvsd). Unlike dvsd, it uses 4:1:1 sampling structure for both NTSC and PAL.

DVHD	DVHD	50Mbps Consumer DV. SD-DVCR 1125-60 or SD-DVCR 1250-50. See also dvsl and dvsd.
DVSD	DVSD	25Mbps Consumer DV. SD-DVCR 525-60 or SD-DVCR 625-50. See also dvsl and dvhd. Implemented in the miroVideo DV300 SW only codec which requires the presence of the 1394 (Firewire) interface card with which it shipped. Used by Adobe After Effects, Uleads Mediastudio 6 (and probably VideoStudio) as a generic DV FOURCC. Probably the same as "dvsd". Sources indicate that these FOURCCs were used interchangeably in early versions. Microsoft indicates here that this codec should be considered obsolete now that standard FOURCCs for the various DV flavours have been defined.
DVSL	DVSL	SD-DVCR 525-60 or SD-DVCR 625-50. See also dvsd and dvhd.
DVX1	DVX1	No information available for this codec.
DVX2	DVX2	No information available for this codec.

It can be used for a range of applications including video-conferencing, Internet video or surveillance and monitoring. Existing video software, such as Windows® Media Player® and Ulead Media Studio® can utilize this codec to play, create, convert and edit."
LBYR	LBYR	Based on the naming, I would hazard a guess that this describes some Bayer image format and may have been registered by LEAD Technologies. Can anyone confirm or deny?
LCMW	LCMW	LEAD MCMW Video Codec. This is a wavelet-based codec. LEAD tell me "The MCMW Codec is designed to create high-quality video using low bandwidth (dial-up) delivery. This is achieved by using a state of the art intraframe wavelet based compression technique that provides superior compression performance, while still ensuring optimal quality at any compression level."

QPEG	QPEG	Q-Team Dr.Knabe's 8-bit output codec with automatic palette switching for seamless edits.
QPEQ	QPEQ	No information available for this codec.
RGBT	RGBT	That's odd. I registered RGBT at the same time as a bunch of other FOURCCs and it was granted. The format I registered is for 16- and 32-bit uncompressed RBG images with a transparency plane. Microsoft's codec site, however, lists Computer Concepts rather than Brooktree (Conexant) as the owner.
RLE 	RLE 	I expect this is an equivalent to one of the the BI_RLEx FOURCCs. The Win2K clock.avi sample uses this format. Final character in the FOURCC is a space.

RV20	RV20	RealVideo G2 (6.0 and greater versions of the player and encoder)
RV30	RV30	No information available for this codec.
RV40	RV40	Apparently you need to install RealPlayer 10 to enable playback of any AVI encoded with RV40.
S422	S422	VideoCap C210. YUV422 codec shipped as part of the driver package for Tekram's C210 product.
SAN3	SAN3	A direct copy of DivX 3.11a, apparently. If you use a FOURCC changer tool on these AVIs they will play with the standard DivX codecs.

SEDG	SEDG	MPEG-4 hardware and software codec used in Samsung digital video products.
SFMC	SFMC	Surface Fitting Method. CrystalGram video email codec.

SMSV	SMSV	Windows 95 codec installed automatically (and without warning) whenever you receive and play back a file sent from VisualMail. Very low bandwidth format.
SP40	SP40	Appears to be an uncompressed YUV format of some kind but I have no information on this other than that.
SP44	SP44	Presumably a precursor to SP54?
SP54	SP54	Apparently a form of MJPEG but with some header or other missing. Software shipped with a number of low end digital cameras and webcams such as Aiptek's Pocketcam digital still camera, Logitech's ClickSmart and Mustek's gSmart mini 2 use this format. These use SunPlus chipsets so presumably this explains the "SP".

VLV1	VLV1	Codec probably used in VideoLogic's Captivator product line.
VP30	VP30	On2 tell me "On2's VP3 codec will encode video into a VP3 file in multiple bit rates (roughly 220 Kbps, 330 Kbps, and 440 Kbps) and at optimum frame rates (usually 29.97 fps). This multiple bit rate file allows the TrueCast server to scale dynamically and smoothly as bandwidth congestion increases and decreases, providing the viewer with a consistent and reliable experience, without choppiness or interruption."
VP31	VP31	The successor to VP30. This algorithm was open sourced by On2 in 2001-2002 and is the basis for the Theora Video Codec: http://www.theora.org/
